# 🧐 About Me
Hi, I am a PhD student at the [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), advised by **Prof. Yi Bao**. My main research area is **AI for acoustic sensing**. Before that, I got my master degree from [Shenzhen University](((https://en.szu.edu.cn/))), with the supervision of **Prof. Jianbo Zhu**. At SZU, my research areas are **Rock Mechanics** and **Wave Propagation**.

### 🤔 Research Interests:
* AI for Science.
* Acoustic monitoring.
* Wave propagation.
* Mechanics.
